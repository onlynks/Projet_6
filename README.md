Install the application
========================

You need to install Composer if you don't already get it.  
First, use the SQL code to create the Database. It already contain some data (tricks and categories).*

-----------------

Once the database is installed, you can clone the project in your directory.

## 1th step: Parameters

Go to the app/config/parameters file and fil those fields accordind to your settings:
    database_host:   
    database_port:   
    database_name:   
    database_user:   
    database_password:   
    mailer_transport:   
    mailer_host:   
    mailer_user:   
    mailer_password:   
   
## 2th step: Composer dependencies

Do the command composer update that will install all the depencies.

_(You can delete the SQL File cloned at the same time as the project)_

# That's it! You can now use the application!
